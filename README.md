# Constructor-Word-Guess

Things that work:
1. The game runs successfully
2. it prompts you to guess a letter and type it from keyboard
3. It gives you randomly selected words to guess
4. if guessed letter is incorrect - it gives you a notice
5. if guessed letter is correct it gives you a correct notice
6. it doesn't mean you win or loose the game goes to the next random selected word


Things to consider building, but don't have time right now:
1. handle if the same letter guessed 
2. prompt validation on guesses: secure from bad imput!
